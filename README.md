Of course. Here is a comprehensive README.md file for the healthcare backend code.

Healthcare Backend API üè•
A robust RESTful API for a healthcare application built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. This backend system provides secure user registration, authentication using JWT, and complete CRUD functionality for managing patient and doctor records.

‚ú® Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Patient Management: Authenticated users can create, retrieve, update, and delete their own patient records.

Doctor Management: Authenticated users can add and manage doctor information.

Patient-Doctor Mapping: Assign doctors to specific patients and manage these relationships.

Secure & Scalable: Built with best practices, including environment variable management and a structured project layout.

Validation: Input validation on API routes to ensure data integrity.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

ORM: Sequelize

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs)

Validation: express-validator

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)

PostgreSQL

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Rishidubey15/healthcare-backend.git
cd healthcare-backend
Install NPM packages:

Bash

npm install
Set up the database:

Log in to PostgreSQL.

Create a new database for the project.

SQL

CREATE DATABASE healthcare_db;
Create an environment variables file:

Create a new file named .env in the root of the project.

Copy and paste the following content into it, replacing the values with your PostgreSQL credentials.

Code snippet

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000

# Database Configuration
DB_USER=your_postgres_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=healthcare_db

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_for_jwt
JWT_EXPIPIRES_IN=1h
Running the Application
To run the server in development mode with auto-reloading:

Bash

npm run dev
The server will start on http://localhost:5000 or the port you specified in your .env file.

API Endpoints
All endpoints are prefixed with /api. An (Auth) tag indicates that a valid JWT Bearer Token is required in the Authorization header.
